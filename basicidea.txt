Create a python program which on execution makes a screen in the terminal itself,
 where you have 4 dummy options, you can only select them with the help of arrow keys
  arrow up and down will select the options and arrow right as well as the enter key will select 
  the option. Based on these 4 options, return back to the previous terminal screen and render some 
  output over there. Any output will suffice. Try making this as a coffee shop application for the
   terminal, where you have 4 options, have a latte, have a chocolate coffee, have some snacks, 
   just have the wifi password. Where if the user selects coffee, the output to the previous screen will
    be Here is your coffee, if the user selects chocolate coffee, it returns the output as “Here is your
     chocolate coffee”, on occasion of the third one, it returns “Here are your snacks. They include 
     sandwitches and biscuits”. And the 4th one will yeild the output as “The wifi password here is ‘1234567890’. 

 

Now the question is how are you going to achieve this. So try exploring the curses library in python. Try making this application your own and then push it to github as a public repository so that anybody can have a look.
